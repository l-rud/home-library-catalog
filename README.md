## Skill-based assignment creating an express server application   
     
### The server functions as a basic home library catalog system where books are organized by genres and authors.
  
### Description
Express server utilizes various middleware for parsing requests, logging, API key validation, routing, error handling, and serving static files, making it ready to handle web requests for a web application.    

GET, POST, PATCH, and DELETE routes have been created for authors, books, and genre data categories. Each route handles HTTP requests and sends appropriate responses, including error handling.    
       
The server uses an EJS templating engine to render views, displaying genre data to the client.
